## Biography (sort of)

My name is David Barrera. I'm from Ecuador :earth_americas:. I started in programming very early in my life with LOGO, when I was 6 years old. Remember those floppy disks :floppy_disk:? I still have mine with the great art I used to make back then (landscape with a house, a mountain and sun). During high school I learned PASCAL (which I remember jack nowadays). Thanks to [edx](https://www.edx.org/) and MIT, with the [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming using Python](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-7), I finally got to understand the concepts of Object Oriented Programming back in 2013, after several failed attempts to understand it with C# in previous years (I almost failed university because of this).

I consider myself a Backend Developer (although no degree). My favorite frameworks to work with are Django and Flask. With the release of [.Net Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download), ASP.NET Core has become my new playground (still strugling with LinQ), but I'm still faithful to Python :snake:.
